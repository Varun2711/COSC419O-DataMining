cf4b9a15571d96feb2b3c26f95d3f3f0703f59d3,"feat: client overhaul proof of concept (#45844)

* chore: initial setup of web package

This is *not* a workspace, yet, because it would be nice to use the
latest React, but /client can't migrate (yet).

Having two React versions creates issues in workspaces since /.bin/next
gets hoisted to root... and finds the root React version :(

* feat: add config for next

* fix: use jsx-runtime for web linting

* chore: init curriculum-server with json-server

* chore: integrate curriculum-server with TS/eslint

* feat: add patch script

json-server doesn't like keys with '/'s in so, for now I'm just patching
them out.

This lets us keep a strong separation between this WIP and the rest of
the code.

* fix: use port 8000 to avoid conflicts

* feat: crude ISR demo using challenge pages

* feat: extend ISR demo to use params

* feat: return props for specific superblocks

* chore: re-organise folders

* refactor: put data fetching in a single module

* refactor: challenge page slightly

* feat: add link to test ISR

You can see that, if you run next dev, the linked page gets regenerated
whenever you navigate to it.  However, if you run next build that is no
longer the case and the page has to be reloaded for the user to see the
latest version.

The implication is that we'll need another method (Web worker, probably)
to detect if the page needs to be updated.

* feat: render static paths for rwd

* feat: add monaco Editor

* feat: send less data via props

Rather than sending superblocks, this now sends blocks. Next step, just
the challenge!

* fix: only send individual challenge's data

* feat: send /learn/stuff/<id> to the challenge page

* fix: redirect to path with trailing id

* fix: handle all possible path prefixes

* feat: add superblocks with trailing ids

* chore: rename block -> blockOrId

* chore: remove logs

* fix: return notFound if page id is missing

* chore: add a note about increasing TS strictness

* feat: serverside redirects

This should be a touch more performant, but mostly it separates the
concerns.

Since the server already has the responsibility of choosing what pages
to render, redirects fit naturally with its concerns.

* refactor: clean up param validation

* feat: create list of blocks in superblock

* feat: add challenge links to map

* feat: link to full path, not just id

* refactor: ensure props match getStaticProps

By specifying the props for GetStaticProps we ensure that it returns the
expected data and use InferGetStaticPropsType to get the type out again
for use in the component

* feat: improve and document dev experience

* refactor: separate routing from rendering

* refactor: extract routing logic into functions

* refactor: naming consistency

* refactor: move data wrangling into get-curriculum

* refactor: align blockOrId and id

* chore: remove the server from workspaces

* chore: remove the lock

* docs: paths

* fix: fallback to english challenges

All challenges will use the english version if a translated file is not
available.  SHOW_NEW_CURRICULUM still gates what's shown in the client.

* refactor: use closures to simplify createChallenge

* refactor: remove messy destructure

* refactor: add meta via helper

* fix: fallback to [] for meta.required

* fix: repair challenge.block

* refactor: use CONST_CASE for meta + challenge dirs

* fix: catch empty superblocks immediately

* fix: clean up path.resolves

* fix: invalid syntax in JS project steps

* fix: default to english comments and relax tests

Instead of always throwing errors when a comment is not translated, the
tests now warn while SHOW_UPCOMING_CHANGES is true, so that tests will
pass while we're developing and allow translators time to work.

They still throw when SHOW_UPCOMING_CHANGES is false to catch issues
in production

* test: update createCommentMap test

* refactor: delete stale comment

* refactor: clarify validate with explanatory consts

Rather than creating an [[]] the parser now creates [] which isEmpty().
This makes the test suite check the next challenge for a solution.

In addition, the logic for testing solutions was fixed.

* feat: use legacy flag

chore: reorder challenges

fix: linter

revert: server change

feat: unblock new editor

fix: proper order

fix: 0-based order

fix: broke the order

feat: move tribute certification to its own block

feat: split the old projects block into 4

fix: put all blocks in order

chore: add intro text

refactor: use block, not blockName in query

fix: project progress indicator

* fix: reorder new challenges/certs

* fix: reorder legacy challenges

* fix: reintroduce legacy certs

* feat: add showNewCurriculum flag to env

* chore: forgot sample.env

* feat: use feature flag for display

* fix: rename meta + dirs to match new blocks

* fix: add new blocks to help-category-map

* fix: update completion-modal for new GQL schema

* test: duplicate title/id errors ->  warnings

* fix: update completion-modal to new GQL schema Mk2

* chore: re-order metas (again)

* fix: revert super-block-intro changes

The intro needs to show both legacy and new content.  We need to decide
which pages are created, rather than than what a page shows when
rendered.

* feat: move upcoming curriculum into own superblock

* fix: handle one certification with two superBlocks

* fix: remove duplicated intros

* fix: remove duplicate projects from /settings

* fix: drop 'two' from Responsive Web Design Two

* chore: rename slug suffix from two to v2

* feat: control display of new curriculum

* feat: control project paths shown on /settings

* fix: use new project order for /settings

This does mean that /settings will change before the release, but I
don't think it's serious.  All the projects are there, just not in the
legacy order.

* fix: claim/show cert button

* chore: remove isLegacy

Since we have legacy superblocks, we don't currently need individual
blocks to be legacy

* test: fix utils.test

* fix: verifyCanClaim needs certification

If Shaun removes the cert claim cards, maybe we can remove this entirely

* fix: add hasEditableBoundaries flags where needed

* chore: remove isUpcomingChange

* chore: v2 -> 22

Then we can rely on the presence of the editor and monaco and don't have
litter the code with null checks.

* refactor: use better name for editable region init

* refactor: remove unused decoration

* refactor: rename forbidden region init functions

* fix: keep all challengeFiles when resetting

* refactor: remove unused decoration class

* fix: reinitialize editor on reset

* fix: stop adding multiple scroll listeners

Since the challengeFile update on each keystroke extra (unnecessary)
adding of listeners slowed the editor to a crawl.

* fix: only scroll to editor on mount

Rather than on any edit.

* refactor: remove logs and comments

* fix: rename toSortedArray and fix broken test

* fix: check for null not falsy in updateFile

* fix: only update project features when project

* fix: only reset if editor contents have changed

* feat: focus on editor after reset",Oliver Eyton-Williams,ojeytonwilliams,2021-10-01T08:36:20Z

b5019000bbfe12dfccfc144293d69285e237d756,"fix(client): errors with multiple editor tabs (#43549)

* fix: enforce multifile tab order

* fix: sort challengeFiles to prevent remounts

If the challengeFiles are used unsorted, this can unmount an editor.
The editors rely on the mount hook for initialization, so extra mounts
can cause unwanted behaviour.

* fix: make editor tabs and panes match",Oliver Eyton-Williams,ojeytonwilliams,2021-09-24T14:40:18Z

Okay apparently the test does not work unless we separate it into
a different `it` statement.

* fix: remove circular dependency

redux depended on templates/Challenges/redux and vice versa.  This
meant that import order mattered and confusing bugs could arise.

(cherry picked from commit 7d67a4e70922bbb3051f2f9982dcc69e240d43dc)

* feat: require imports to be in alphabetical order

Import order generally does not matter, but there are edge cases
(circular  imports and css imports, for example) where changing order
changes behaviour

(cherry picked from commit b8d1393a91ec6e068caf8e8498a5c95df68c2b2c)

* chore: order imports

* fix: lift up challenge description + title comps

This brings the classic Show closer to the others as they
now all create the description and title components

* fix: remove donation-saga/index circular import

(cherry picked from commit 51a44ca668a700786d2744feffeae4fdba5fd207)

* refactor: extract action-types from settings

Co-authored-by: gikf <60067306+gikf@users.noreply.github.com>

* fix: manual review suggestions

Apply gikf's other suggestions.

* feat: more thorough testing

When a test asserts that a camper adds a new element relative to
an existing element, also test that the existing element is not
malformed.

* feat: optional semi colons

Make EOL semi-colons optional in the CSS. If they're missing and the
CSS doesn't render correctly, other tests will catch that. If they
are on the last property of the ruleset, they technically aren't
required so we shouldn't require them?

6631e511137cd49717915658ace58dc56ff7eefb,"fix(curriculum): update object keys referenced in instructions to match provided object (#42613)

* Update referenced object keys for clarity

Because each movie object has both `Rated` and `imdbRating` key/value pairs, simply referencing `rating` could be confusing to campers. IMO explicitly referencing the keys by name (`Title` and `imdbRating`) removes ambiguity in the non-important part of this challenge and helps campers focus on learning about `.map()`.

* other references and tests

* Update curriculum/challenges/english/02-javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/use-the-map-method-to-extract-data-from-an-array.md

* reverse previous changes

* Replaced lookbehinds with matches

* Reverted to using \s instead of .

Now only matches if event.preventDefault() call is the only thing in the comment. This avoids matching note comments like ""need to call event.preventDefault() here""

* Added optional semicolons for both comment checks

This should be equivalent to the two original lookbehinds

63156dffee264b5b8256faa9759b5f7b7b2fbf2f,"CodeSee take 2 (#42330)

* Adds CodeSee developer tooling to FreeCodeCamp client

CodeSee is a continuous code understanding platform,
meant to help developers when diving into a codebase.

This is an alpha version, which enables FCC contributors
to create and explore recordings of code execution on the
front-end. These recordings are meant to help orient a
developer to an unfamiliar part of the codebase, or help
diagnose when behavior is not matching our mental model.

When running in development, the client will now display
a small, purple CodeSee icon in the browser. Clicking this
icon starts (then stops) a new recording.

* chore(deps): update to @codesee/latest

* feat: switch to CodeSee hosted

* chore(deps): add process to root

I couldn't pin down what, exactly, but something in the client depends
on safer-buffer from the root, which tries to find process/browser, so
it needs installing here too.

5d46e2830aff78ae4090028393fbe86c8ce29ef3,"feat: add Docker build (#41187)

* feat(docker): build and use client and api images

* feat: always use .env

dotenv fails without throwing if the .env file is missing and never
overwrites variables if they already exist. As such, we can use it in
build pipelines.

* fix: remove quotes from env vars

dotenv normalises quoted and unquoted strings (X=x, X='x' and
X=""x"") all become the same .env object {X: 'x'}. However, Docker's
env_file does not (the three cases are distinct).  As a result, we
should use unquoted strings for consistency.

* fix: provide custom warning when .env is missing

* feat(docker): include client-config

* fix(docker): remove build packages from api image

* fix(docker): run script from correct dir

* fix(docker): correct permissions and dests

* fix(docker): consolidate run steps

This is standard practice, but did not have a noticable affect on the
image size

* fix(docker): clean the npm cache

Prior to this step the image was 1.11GB uncompressed and we got a modest
saving, 1.09GB after.

* refactor(docker): regexless COPY directives

* feat(docker): use alpine

This shrinks the image down to 259MB

* fix(docker): update build scripts

* fix: correct the server Dockerfile RUNs

* DEBUG: expose mysql port for seeding

* chore: update client Dockerfile's node versions

* fix: remove executable permissions from index.js

It's not a cli, so I don't think it needs to be executable.

* chore: update node and remove stale comments

* feat: use ENTRYPOINT + CMD to allow runtime config

* fix: add CURRICULUM_LOCALE arg

* feat: allow client port configuration

* feat: allow api port to be configured

* refactor: use unique variable names for ports

* fix: add default CLIENT_PORT

11dfe9274fb358008bd7eb7718b3901a87afcea4,"fix catastrophic backtracking when removing HTML comments (#40223)

* fix catastrophic backtracking when removing HTML comments

The regexp `/<!--(.|\s)*?-->/g` can experience catastrophic backtracking while matching a string like `<!--                                           -- >` (notice how it does not end with `-->`).    

[You can see the catastrophic backtracking in action here](https://regex101.com/r/2jvwFi/1/debugger). 

This is because both `.` and `\s` matches the space character, and there are therefore a large number of possible ways for `(.|\s)*` to match a long sequence of spaces.  
The regexp evaluator is greedy, and the problem therefore only exists when the string does not match the regexp. 

The fix is simply to remove the ambiguity such that there is only one possible way for the regexp to match a sequence of white-space.

a8346724372ea23ffbe67a8a01f54e6441b4cb2e,"Fix low-contrast CSS strings in code blocks (#39967) (#39987)

First noticed on the challenge ""Divide the Grid Into an Area Template"", text is hard to read in night mode due to low contrast in the CSS code block. Problem was discussed in issue #39967, and this change was proposed to boost contrast above the minimum acceptable ratio of 4.5:1.

This change only targets CSS code blocks in night mode, and only strings. I could not find code blocks in other languages with this issue, but they may exist.
This also does not target `.token.operator`, `.token.entity`, or `.token.url`. There is no issue here with contrast, but these classes do not include a background. A proposed future change could be to remove the background from `.token.string` as well, but this change is not made here, as current style guides recommend the background.",Eli Carlin-Coleman,EliBCC,2020-10-16T11:52:16Z

* fix: fixed several issues after move to mono repo (#31)

This PR has the following items:

1. Introduces a couple of fixes to the sweeper script from issues right before the move to the mono repo.  These were related to moving labeler out of the root of the sweeper folder and placing into the pr-tasks sub-folder.

2. Combined two scripts which were being used to update the data manually on Glitch (pr-relations.glitch.me).  The new one-off script (get-pr-relations-data.js) downloads the current data.json and then pulls down applicable Github data which updates the data.json and automatically uploads it back to the Glitch server.

3. In an effort to use the same log file across all current one-off scripts and sweeper.js, the ProcessLog class was modified, so now every log created has the same JSON structure as is uploaded to the Glitch server.  This removed a lot of redundant code across 3 files.

4. During a pair-coding session with @honmanyau, we tweaked the UI for the Dashboard app to give it a more consistent look across all views.

5. Based on feedback from a couple of the moderators using the new Dashboard app, the PR title was added along with some other styling. 

6. Added some environment variables for running dashboard-api and dashboard-client in a development mode.

7.  Added a sample_data.json file as a starter file, so someone does not have to do a full data pull to get things up and running. 

8. Modified Pareto view to only display files with 2 or more PRs to speed up the report.

In an earlier PR I use `joi` to make PRODUCTION_RUN environment variables a Boolean, but did not change to the correct reference and did not change the code logic to compare to a Boolean instead of a String value (as it had been before).  This PR corrects that logic, so that the one-off scripts will work in a production mode again.  Also, removed the now unnecessary ` SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK` environment variable from the `probot/.env` file.

f5feff386a00c171920f5fcf08ffaec79f081adf,"fix: stop user code after 500ms of execution

Code like `var xs = []; while(true){ xs.push(1) }` can quickly run the
browser out of memory causing it to crash.  These changes stop user loops
from running indefinitely so that common mistakes will no longer cause
the browser to crash.

Also, the user is informed if a long running loop is detected (js and
jsx challenges) during preview or testing.  Before this there was no
protection for js challenges and no information was given to the
user if they had created such a loop.
